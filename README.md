# covid19-prediction
Using deep learning to predict if x-ray images of patients contain covid19 or not. Heavily inspired by Adrian Rosebrock's [article](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2020/03/16/detecting-covid-19-in-x-ray-images-with-keras-tensorflow-and-deep-learning/) over at [pyimagesearch.com](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/)

TODO:
- clean up code
- train on gpu
- check efficientNet or Resnet50 transfer learning
- make decent README.md
